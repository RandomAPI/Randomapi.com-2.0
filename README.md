# RandomAPI

### About
RandomAPI is a fully customizable data generator that returns results via RESTful API. After seeing the success of [Random User Generator](https://randomuser.me) and the demand for random data by designers and developers, RandomAPI was created to help provide custom tailored data to populate databases and mockups using javascript as the language of choice to code APIs.

APIs, in the context of RandomAPI, are Javascript programs that a user creates to specify the different types of fields and values they want to generate for their specific application.
